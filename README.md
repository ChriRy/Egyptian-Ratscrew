# Overview

This is a digital version of the card game 'Egyptian Ratscrew.' This beta version is designed as a two player game with one player using the 'wasd' keys and the other using the arrow keys. 

Egyptian Ratscrew has always been one of my favorite card games, and I wanted to get to know Gamemaker Studio better, so this was the result.

# Development Environment

The game was developed in Gamemaker Studio 2, an software used for created 2D software and games. 

Gamemaker uses it's own language, referred to as GML. It's very similar to Javascript, though it does have some of the nice quality of life features that are found in python.
